These directories contain programs and datasets related in some way
to "Introduction to Data Compression" by K. Sayood, published by 
Morgan-Kaufmann Publishers.  The directory structure is as follows

                            /pub/sayood

The programs themselves and a Makefile are in the programs directory.  The
programs have been written in C.  They have been tested on a number of 
workstations and PCs.  They have always compiled under gcc, and should compile 
using other compilers as well.  If you do not have a copy of gcc you can
find out how to obtain it (and other gnu programs) from
prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP.  

These programs are not production quality.  Their main purpose is to help 
the reader explore different data compression techniques.  They should be 
quite easy to modify for a specific application and you are welcome to 
do so.  If you have suggestions or discover any bugs it would be greatly 
appreciated if you could let us know at xxx.

The documentation for the programs have been provided in two ways.  The
subdirectory man contains the documentation in a form suitable for man
pages on unix systems.  You can generate the man page for a particular
program called "prog" by using nroff

                 nroff -man prog.1 | more

or by putting the files in the man directory into /usr/local/man/man1
and typing "man prog".  The subdirectory doc contains the same documents
in ASCII.  You can also get help on how to use a program by running it with
the option -h.  Thus "prog -h" will get you information on how to run
the program.

Most of the examples in the book were generated using these programs.  If
you are reading the book you might find it helpful to repeat the examples
in the book.

The subdirectories of the dataset directory contain various datasets for you
to experiment with.  Where there was not a problem with copyright we have 
included the datasets that were used in the book.  The datasets are separated
into their own subdirectories.  

The image datasets are 8 bits per pixel grey level images stored in raster
scan order.  If you have a viewer that does not permit viewing of raw images,
you can use the convpgm program to convert the images to pgm format.  If
you are working on a PC with a VGA display you can use the "showimg" program
to display these images.

The audio and speech datasets have been obtained by digitizing speech or
audio using a 16 bit linear A/D.  The audio input was sampled at 44,100 samples
per second while the speech data was sampled at 8000 samples per second.

There are quite a few very good programs available in the public domain
which implement different data compression techniques or standards.  The
subdirectory "other" contains pointers to some of these programs.
