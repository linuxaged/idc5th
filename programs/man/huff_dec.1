.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B huff_dec 
[
.BI \-i " infile"
][
.BI \-o " outfile"
][
.BI \-c " codefile"
][
.B \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
This program takes an file encoded using huff_enc and decodes it.  It will 
either read a code to use from a file or it will read the code that was
written as a header on the encoded file.

The program needs the following subroutines:
.IP getcode
.LP
and the header im.h

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-i " infile"
The name of the file containing the output of huff_enc.  If this option is
not used the program reads from standard in.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
This will contain the decoded file.  If this option is not used
the program writes the decoded file to standard out.
.TP
.BI \-c " codefile"
The name of the file if you want to use a stored code instead
of one written as a header. The defalt is to read one as a
header.
.TP
.BI \-h
This will produce the usage.
.SH BUGS
If the file was encoded using the -c option and huff_dec is not provided 
with the right codefile, anything can happen.
