.SH NAME
progt_dec \- decodes files encoded by progt_enc to obtain approximations.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B progt_enc 
[
.BI \-i " infile"
][
.BI \-o " outfile"
][
.B \-h
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program can be used along with progt_enc to experiment with different 
approximations to use for progressive transmission application.  This program
acts as a decoder for progt_enc.

The program needs no subroutines.
.IP readimage
.IP image_size
.LP
and the header file idc.h

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-i " infile"
This contains the binary code for the approximation generated by progt_enc.  
If this option is not used the program reads the approximation from standard in.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
The name of the file containing the reconstructed approximation.
The image is stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw format.
.TP
.BI \-h
This option will provide the usage.
