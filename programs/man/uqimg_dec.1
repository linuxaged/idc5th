.SH NAME
uqimg_dec \- decodes a file created by uqimg_enc to obtain a reconstructed 
image.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP

[
.BI \-i " infile"
][
.BI \-o " outfile"
][
.B \-h
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program provides a reconstruction for an image compressed using 
uqimg_enc (uniform quantization).  The output is a grey-scale
(8 bits/pixel) image which can be written to a file or to standard out.
The input to this program can be from a file or from standard in.  


The program needs the following subroutines:
.IP decuqi
.IP unstuff
.LP
and the header file idc.h

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-i " infile"
This contains the compressed image.  The various parameters required
for decompression are also stored in the same file.  If this option is not
used the program reads from standard in.  This is useful
if the input to the program is to be generated by a variable length decoder.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
The name of the file containing the reconstructed image.  The image is
stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw format.  If this option is not used the
image is written to standard out.

.TP
.BI \-h
This option will provide the usage.
