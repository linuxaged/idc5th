.SH DESCRIPTION
This program can be used to explore the effect of mismatch between the
assumptions about the quantizer input used to design a uniform quantizer,
and the actual input statistics.  This program can be used to explore
both mismatch between the assumed and actual distribution and mismatch
between the actual and assumed variances.  The quantizer and input 
parameters are specified by the user.  


The program simulates a range of input variances, specified by the user.

The program needs the following subroutines:
.IP rangen
.IP uquan_enc
.IP uquan_dec
.IP ent
.LP
and the header file idc.h

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-l " numlev"
This is the size of the reproduction alphabet of the quantizer.
.TP
.BI \-q " stepsize"
This is the size of the quantization interval (Delta).
.TP
.BI \-n " num"
This is the number of inputs to be generate for the simulation.  It is difficult
to get a reasonably accurate estimate with num less than 10,000.
.TP
.BI \-d " distribution"
This is a number specifying the input probability distribution
A value of 0 corresponds to Uniform distribution.
A value of 1 corresponds to Gaussian distribution.
A value of 2 corresponds to Laplacian distribution.
A value of 3 corresponds to Gamma distribution.  This
last option should be used with care, as the function
generating the Gamma distribution is not entirely reliable.
.TP
.BI \-b " min_std"
This is the smallest value of the range of standard deviations to be generated
.TP
.BI \-m " max_std"
This is the largest value of the range of standard deviations to be generated
.TP
.BI \-s " std_step"
The standard deviations to be generated are incremented in steps of std_step.
.TP
.BI \-e
If this option is specified the program calculates the output entropy
of the quantizer.
.TP
.BI \-h
This option will provide the usage.
