NAME
     vqimg_enc - compresses an image using vector quantization.

SYNOPSIS
     vqimg_enc [ -i imagein ][ -o cmpfile ][ -c  codebook  ][  -x
          row_size ][ -y col_size ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to compress an image  using  vector
     quantization.  The codebook is obtained using the trvqsp_img
     program. The dimensions of the vector and the  size  of  the
     codebook  are specified in the file containing the codebook.
     The indices of the vectors are coded using  a  fixed  length
     code.   Thus  more compression can be obtained if the output
     of this program is encoded using a  variable  length  coder.
     If  an output file is not specified the output is written to
     standard out.  This feature can be used to pipe  the  output
     of  this  program  directly to a variable length coder.  The
     images are assumed to be  8  bit  grey-level  images  stored
     using raster scan order.

     The dimensions of the image can be specified by the user  or
     obtained directly by the program.  The program "knows" about
     only a small set of standard image sizes.  The user can  add
     to  the  set by editing the file image_size.c.  Or, the user
     can simply specify the dimensions of the image  at  run-time
     using the options -x and -y.

     The codefile contains the codebook in  binary  format.   The
     codebook  is preceded by a 12 byte header which contains the
     dimensions of the vector as well as the size  of  the  code-
     book.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     vqencode

     readimage

     image_size

     stuffit

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i imagein
          This is the image to be compressed.  It is assumed that
          this  image is a grey scale (8 bits/pixel) image stored
          in raster scan order.

     -o cmpfile
          This is the compressed file.  The  file  also  contains
          the  name  of the codebook used during vector quantiza-
          tion.

     -c codebook
          This is the codebook used for compression.   The  code-
          book can be generated using trvqsp_img.

     -x row_size
          This is the number of pixels in each row.

     -y col_size
          This is the number of rows in the image.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
