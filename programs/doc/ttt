NAME
     vqimg_dec  -  reconstructs   an   image   compressed   using
     vqimg_enc.

SYNOPSIS
     vqimg_dec [ -i cmpfile ][ -o imageout ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program reconstructs an image which had been compressed
     using vqimg_enc.  The codebook used to compress the image is
     needed along with the compressed image.   The  name  of  the
     codebook is read from the compressed file.  If an input file
     is not specified the input is read from standard in.  If  an
     output  file is not specified the output is written to stan-
     dard out. The images are  8  bit  grey-level  images  stored
     using raster scan order.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     unstuff

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i cmpfile
          This is the compressed file.  The  file  also  contains
          the  name  of the codebook used during vector quantiza-
          tion.

     -o imageout
          This is the reconstructed image.  It  is  assumed  that
          this  image is a grey scale (8 bits/pixel) image and is
          stored in raster scan order.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
