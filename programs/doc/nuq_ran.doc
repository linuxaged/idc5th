NAME
     nuq_ran - explores nonuniform quantization of random inputs.

SYNOPSIS
     nuq_ran qfile [ -n num ][ -d distribution ][ -e ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to explore the performance of  non-
     uniform  quantizers operating on random inputs.  Four possi-
     bilities for the input distribution  are  available.   These
     include  uniform,  Laplacian, Gaussian, and gamma (the gamma
     distribution is not very accurate).  More distributions  can
     be  added by modifying rangen.c and the call to rangen.  The
     quantizer parameters are obtained from the file qfile, while
     the  distribution of the input is specified by the user. The
     file qfile contains  the  number  of  levels,  boundary  and
     reconstruction  values  for  the  nonuniform quantizer.  The
     first number is the number of reconstruction levels  in  the
     quantizer,  numlev.   The  next  (numlev-1)  numbers are the
     inner boundary values (note that there are numlev+1 boundary
     values.  The extreme values are assumed to be plus and minus
     infinity.  The next numlev  values  are  the  reconstruction
     values.  Some quan_files should be available at the location
     you found this program.  The name of the files  are  of  the
     form  xxnn.dat,  xx is ga for Gaussian, la for Laplacian and
     gm for Gamma.  nn denotes the number of levels.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     rangen

     nuquan_enc

     nuquan_dec

     ent

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -n num
          This is the number of inputs to  be  generate  for  the
          simulation.   It is difficult to get a reasonably accu-
          rate estimate with num less than 10,000.

     -d distribution
          This is a number specifying the input probability  dis-
          tribution A value of 0 corresponds to Uniform distribu-
          tion.  A value of 1 corresponds to  Gaussian  distribu-
          tion.    A   value   of   2  corresponds  to  Laplacian
          distribution.  A value of 3 corresponds to  Gamma  dis-
          tribution.   This last option should be used with care,
          as the function generating the  Gamma  distribution  is
          not entirely reliable.

     -e   If this option is specified the program calculates  the
          output entropy of the quantizer.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
