NAME
     entfile - computes the zero order entropy of a a file.

SYNOPSIS
     entfile file

DESCRIPTION
     This program counts the number of times different eight  bit
     characters  in  a  file occur, uses the counts to generate a
     zero order probability model, and then computes the  entropy
     for this model.

     The program needs the subroutine ent.
