NAME
     dpcm_dec - reconstructs a speech or  audio  file  compressed
     using dpcm_enc and predictor.

SYNOPSIS
     dpcm_dec [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     The program reconstructs a  speech  or  audio  file  encoded
     using  dpcm_enc.   The  program reads the names of the quan-
     tizer file and predictor  file  from  the  compressed  file.
     These  files should be available to the program in order for
     reconstruction to take place.  The output is stored  in  raw
     format  (no  headers)  using 16 bits/sample.  If you want to
     play the output you  might  have  to  swap  the  byte  order
     depending on your machine.

     The quantizer file contains the number of  levels,  boundary
     and reconstruction values for the nonuniform quantizer.  The
     first number is the number of reconstruction levels  in  the
     quantizer,  numlev.   The  next  (numlev-1)  numbers are the
     inner boundary values (note that there are numlev+1 boundary
     values.  The extreme values are assumed to be plus and minus
     infinity.  The next numlev  values  are  the  reconstruction
     values.  Some quan_files should be available at the location
     you found this program.  The name of the files  are  of  the
     form  xxnn.dat,  xx is ga for Gaussian, la for Laplacian and
     gm for Gamma.  nn denotes the number of levels.

     The predictor file contains the order of the predictor  fol-
     lowed by the predictor coefficients.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     nuquan_dec

     predictor

     unstuff

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          This is the compressed  speech or audio file.

     -o outfile
          The reconstructed speech or audio is stored in outfile.
          The output samples are stored using 16 bits/ sample.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
