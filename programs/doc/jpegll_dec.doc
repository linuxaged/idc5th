NAME
     jpegll_dec - reconstructs an image that  has  been  decorre-
     lated by jpegll_enc.

SYNOPSIS
     jpegll_dec [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program reconstructs a grey-level (8 bits/pixel)  image
     from  the residuals obtained by using jpegll_enc.  The input
     can come from a file or from standard in.  The output can be
     written  to  a  file  or  standard  out.   If  the output of
     jpegll_enc was encoded using a variable length code, a vari-
     able   length   decoder   needs  to  be  employed  prior  to
     jpegll_dec.  The output of the variable length  decoder  can
     be piped to this program.

     The program does not need any subroutines.


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The  name  of  the  file  containing  the   output   of
          jpegll_enc.   If  this  option  is not used the program
          reads from standard in.

     -o outfile
          This will contain the  reconstructed  image.   If  this
          option  is  not  used  the  program writes the image to
          standard out.

     -h   This will produce the usage.
