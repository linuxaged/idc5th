NAME
     uqimg_dec - decodes a file created by uqimg_enc to obtain  a
     reconstructed image.

SYNOPSIS
     uqimg_dec [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This  program  provides  a  reconstruction  for   an   image
     compressed using uqimg_enc (uniform quantization).  The out-
     put is a grey-scale (8 bits/pixel) image which can be  writ-
     ten to a file or to standard out.  The input to this program
     can be from a file or from standard in.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     decuqi

     unstuff

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          This contains the compressed image.  The various param-
          eters required for decompression are also stored in the
          same file.  If this option  is  not  used  the  program
          reads from standard in.  This is useful if the input to
          the program is to be generated  by  a  variable  length
          decoder.

     -o outfile
          The name  of  the  file  containing  the  reconstructed
          image.   The  image is stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw
          format.  If this option is not used the image is  writ-
          ten to standard out.


     -h   This option will provide the usage.
