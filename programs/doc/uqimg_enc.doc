NAME
     uqimg_enc - compresses an image in  a  lossy  fashion  using
     uniform quantization.

SYNOPSIS
     uqimg_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -l numlev ][ -b  num-
          bits  ][ -m max_value ][ -t min_value ][ -x row_size ][
          -y col_size ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program takes a grey-level  image  (8  bits/pixel)  and
     compresses it in a lossy fashion using uniform quantization.
     The quantizer labels are encoded using a fixed length  code.
     The  output  can  be further encoded using a variable length
     coder for further compression.  The step size of  the  quan-
     tizer  is  the  difference  between  the maximum and minimum
     values divided by the number of  levels.   The  maximum  and
     minimum  values  can  be specified by the user.  The default
     values are 255 and 0.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readimage

     image_size

     encuqi

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The name of the file containing the input  image.   The
          image is assumed to be stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw
          format.

     -o outfile
          This will contain the compressed  image.   The  various
          parameters  required  for decompression are also stored
          in the same file.  If this option is not used the  pro-
          gram  writes  the  decorrelated  image to standard out.
          This is useful if the output of the program  is  to  be
          piped directly to a variable length coder.

     -l numlev
          This is the size of the quantizer  reproduction  alpha-
          bet.   If  this value is provided numbits need  not  be
          speci-  fied.    The   number   of   bits   needed   to
          represent  the  lables, numbits, need not be specified.
          numbits is com- puted as [log_2  numlev]  ([x]  is  the
          smallest integer greater than or equal to x).

     -b numbits
          This is the number of bits needed to  specify  a  quan-
          tizer label.  If this value is specified, the number of
          levels, numlev, need not be specified. numlev is   com-
          puted as numlev = 2^numbits.

     -m max_value
          This is the maximum value  that  the  input  can  take.
          This  value along with min_value is used to compute the
          quantizer step size.  The default max_value is 255.

     -t min_value
          This is the minimum value  that  the  input  can  take.
          This  value along with max_value is used to compute the
          quantizer step size.  The default min_value is 0.

     -x row_size
          This is the number of pixels in each row of the image.

     -y col_size
          This is the number of rows of pixels.

          If the row_size and col_size are not provided the  pro-
          gram  attempts to check to see if the image corresponds
          to any of the standard sizes it is familiar  with.   To
          add to the list of standard sizes, edit image_size.c



     -h   This option will provide the usage.
