NAME
     progt_dec - decodes files encoded  by  progt_enc  to  obtain
     approximations.

SYNOPSIS
     progt_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used along with progt_enc to  experiment
     with   different   approximations  to  use  for  progressive
     transmission application.  This program acts  as  a  decoder
     for progt_enc.

     The program needs no subroutines.

     readimage

     image_size

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          This contains the binary  code  for  the  approximation
          generated  by progt_enc. If this option is not used the
          program reads the approximation from standard in.

     -o outfile
          The name  of  the  file  containing  the  reconstructed
          approximation.   The image is stored using 8 bits/pixel
          in raw format.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
