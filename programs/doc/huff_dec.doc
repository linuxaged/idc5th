NAME
     huff_dec - decodes a file encoded  using  Huffman  encoding,
     encoded using huff_enc.

SYNOPSIS
     huff_dec [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -c codefile ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program  takes  an  file  encoded  using  huff_enc  and
     decodes  it.   It will either read a code to use from a file
     or it will read the code that was written as a header on the
     encoded file.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     getcode

     and the header im.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The name of the file containing the output of huff_enc.
          If this option is not used the program reads from stan-
          dard in.

     -o outfile
          This will contain the decoded file.  If this option  is
          not  used  the program writes the decoded file to stan-
          dard out.

     -c codefile
          The name of the file if you want to use a  stored  code
          instead  of  one  written as a header. The defalt is to
          read one as a header.

     -h   This will produce the usage.

BUGS
     If the file was encoded using the -c option and huff_dec  is
     not provided with the right codefile, anything can happen.
