NAME
     aqfimg_enc - lossy compression of grey  level  images  using
     forward adaptive quantization.

SYNOPSIS
     aqfimg_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -l numlev ][ -b num-
          bits  ][  -s blocksize ][ -x row_size ][ -y col_size ][
          -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program provides lossy compression of a  grey-scale  (8
     bits/pixel)  image using forward adaptive quantization.  The
     maximum and minumum pixel values in a block of  size  block-
     size  is obtained and the image is quantized using a uniform
     quantizer with stepsize equal to the difference between  the
     minimum  and maximum values divided by the number of levels.
     The maximum and minimum values for  each  block  are  stored
     using eight bits while the quantizer labels are stored using
     [log_2 numlev] bits.  The resulting output  can  be  further
     compressed using a variable length code.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readimage

     image_size

     encuqi

     stuffit

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The name of the file containing the input  image.   The
          image is assumed to be stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw
          format.

     -o outfile
          This will contain the compressed  image.   The  various
          parameters  required  for decompression are also stored
          in the same file.  If this option is not used the  pro-
          gram  writes  the  decorrelated  image to standard out.
          This is useful if the output of the program  is  to  be
          piped directly to a variable length coder.

     -l numlev
          If this value is provided numbits need  not  be  speci-
          fied.   The  number  of  bits  needed  to represent the
          lables, numbits, need not be specified. numbits is com-
          puted as 2^numlev.

     -b numbits
          This is the number of bits needed to  specify  a  quan-
          tizer label.  If this value is specified, the number of
          levels, numlev, need not be specified.  numlev is  com-
          puted as numlev = 2^numbits.

     -s blocksize
          This is the size of one side of the square  block  over
          which the quantizer parameters are computed.

     -x row_size
          This is the number of pixels in each row of the image.

     -y col_size
          This is the number of rows of pixels.

          If the row_size and col_size are not provided the  pro-
          gram  attempts to check to see if the image corresponds
          to any of the standard sizes it is familiar  with.   To
          add to the list of standard sizes, edit image_size.c


     -h   This option will provide the usage.
