NAME
     trvqsp_img - trains a vector quantizer  codebook  for  image
     compression  using  the splitting approach for obtaining the
     initial codebook.

SYNOPSIS
     trvqsp_img ts_img codefile [ -b cb_size ][  -t  block_height
          ][ -w block_width ][ -x row_size ][ -y col_size ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to train a vector quantizer for use
     in  image compression using the LBG algorithm.  The codebook
     is initialized using  the  splitting  approach  proposed  by
     Linde,  Buzo, and Gray.  The ts_img is the image used as the
     training set.  The vectors are actually  rectangular  arrays
     which  are  block_height  pixels  tall by block_width pixels
     wide.  Thus the dimension of the vector  is  block_height  X
     block_width.   The images are assumed to be 8 bit grey-level
     images stored using raster scan order.  The program can take
     a  long  time  to  run especially if the size of the desired
     codebook is large.  Therefore it is a good idea to  run  the
     program in background.

     The dimensions of the image can be specified by the user  or
     obtained directly by the program.  The program "knows" about
     only a small set of standard image sizes.  The user can  add
     to  the  set by editing the file image_size.c.  Or, the user
     can simply specify the dimensions of the image  at  run-time
     using the options -x and -y.

     The codefile contains the codebook in  binary  format.   The
     codebook  is preceded by a 12 byte header which contains the
     dimensions of the vector as well as the size  of  the  code-
     book.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     vqencode

     readimage

     image_size

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -b cb_size
          This is the size of the codebook.

     -t block_height
          This is the height of a block of  pixels  making  up  a
          vector.

     -w block_width
          This is the width of the block of pixels  making  up  a
          vector.   The dimension of the vector is block_height X
          block_width.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
