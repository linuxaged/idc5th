NAME
     trvqsplit - trains a vector  quantizer  codebook  using  the
     splitting approach for obtaining the initial codebook.

SYNOPSIS
     trvqsplit ts_file [ -d dimension ][ -b cb_size ][ -t ts_size
          ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to train a vector  quantizer  using
     the  LBG  algorithm.   The codebook is initialized using the
     splitting approach proposed by Linde, Buzo,  and  Gray.   If
     the user wishes to experiment with an initial codebook, s/he
     should use the program trainvq.  The purpose of this program
     is  more  to  allow  the  user  to  explore the process, for
     specific applications the program would have to be modified.
     There  is  also  a  program  available for training a vector
     quantizer specifically for image compression  -  trvqsp_img.
     This  program  does  not  attempt  to resolve the empty cell
     problem.

     The ts_file contains the training set.   The  program  needs
     the following subroutines:

     vqencode

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -d dimension
          This is the dimension of the vectors.

     -b cb_size
          This is the size of the codebook.

     -t ts_size
          This is the size of the training set.  The size of  the
          training  set  should  be  considerably larger than the
          codebook size.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
