NAME
     distimg - computes various performance measures between ori-
     ginal and reconstructed images.

SYNOPSIS
     distimg file1 file2 [ -p peak_value ][  -x  row_size  ][  -y
          col_size ][ -m mode ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program computes the mean squared error, mean  absolute
     error,  signal  to noise ratio (in dB), and the peak signal-
     to-noise ratio (in dB), between file1 and file2.  It assumes
     file1  to  be  the original image and file2 to be the recon-
     structed image.  The images are  assumed  to  be  grey-level
     images (8 bits/pixel) stored in raw format.

     If I[i,j] is the pixel value of the original  image  (file1)
     at  location  i,j  R[i,j]  is  the pixel value of the recon-
     structed image at location i,j,  and  <  >  denotes  average
     value,  then  the performance measures computed by this pro-
     gram are defined as follows.

     mean squared error = <(I[i,j] - R[i,j])^2>.

     mean absolute error = <|I[i,j] - R[i,j]|>.

     signal to noise ratio = <I[i,j]^2> / <(I[i,j] - R[i,j])^2>.

     peak signal to noise  ratio  =  peak_value^2  /  <(I[i,j]  -
     R[i,j])^2>.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readimage

     image_size

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -p peak_value
          This value is used to compute the peak  signal-to-noise
          ratio.   If  no value is provided the program assumes a
          value of 255.

     -x row_size
          This is the number of pixels in each row of the image.

     -y col_size
          This is the number of rows of pixels.

          If the row_size and col_size are not provided the  pro-
          gram  attempts to check to see if the image corresponds
          to any of the standard sizes it is familiar  with.   To
          add to the list of standard sizes, edit image_size.c


     -h   This option will provide the usage.
