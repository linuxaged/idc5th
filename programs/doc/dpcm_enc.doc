NAME
     dpcm_enc - compresses a speech or audio file using dpcm with
     fixed quantizer and predictor.

SYNOPSIS
     dpcm_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][ -q qfile ][  -p  pfile
          ][ -s scale ][ -e ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program uses a fixed quantizer and  predictor  to  dif-
     ferentially  encode  a speech or audio file.  The input data
     is assumed to be in raw format (no  headers)  and  digitized
     using  a  16  bit  linear A/D (be careful of byte ordering).
     The dpcm encoder output is  encoded  using  a  fixed  length
     code.   Further  compression  may be available if a variable
     length code is used.

     The quantizer file contains the number of  levels,  boundary
     and reconstruction values for the nonuniform quantizer.  The
     first number is the number of reconstruction levels  in  the
     quantizer,  numlev.   The  next  (numlev-1)  numbers are the
     inner boundary values (note that there are numlev+1 boundary
     values.  The extreme values are assumed to be plus and minus
     infinity.  The next numlev  values  are  the  reconstruction
     values.  Some quan_files should be available at the location
     you found this program.  The name of the files  are  of  the
     form  xxnn.dat,  xx is ga for Gaussian, la for Laplacian and
     gm for Gamma.  nn denotes the number of levels.

     The predictor file contains the order of the predictor  fol-
     lowed by the predictor coefficients.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readau

     nuquan_enc

     nuquan_dec

     predictor

     norm

     stuffit

     get_file_size

     ent
     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          This is the input speech or audio file.  It is  assumed
          that  the input data is digitized using a 16 bit linear
          A/D.

     -o outfile
          The compressed speech or audio is  stored  in  outfile.
          The  encoder  output  is  encoded  using a fixed length
          code.  More compression may be available if a  variable
          length code is used.

     -q qfile
          The file qfile contains the number of levels,  boundary
          and reconstruction values for the nonuniform quantizer.
          For more details see above.

     -p pfile
          The file pfile contains the order of the predictor  (as
          an int) followed by the predictor coefficients (read as
          floats).  If this option is not used the program uses a
          one tap predictor with predictor coefficient 0.86 (this
          is generally a poor choice).

     -s scale
          This number scales the input  to  the  quantizer.   The
          default value is 1.

     -e   If this option is specified the program calculates  the
          output entropy of the quantizer.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
