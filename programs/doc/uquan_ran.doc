NAME
     uquan_ran - explores uniform quantization of random inputs.

SYNOPSIS
     uquan_ran [ -l numlev ][ -s stepsize ][ -n num ][ -d distri-
          bution ][ -e ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to explore the performance of  uni-
     form quantizers operating on random inputs.  Four possibili-
     ties  for  the  input  distribution  are  available.   These
     include  uniform,  Laplacian, Gaussian, and gamma (the gamma
     distribution is not very accurate).  More distributions  can
     be  added by modifying rangen.c and the call to rangen.  The
     quantizer parameters are specified by the user through  com-
     mand line arguments or through answer to prompts.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     rangen

     uquan_enc

     uquan_dec

     ent

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -l numlev
          This is the size of the reproduction  alphabet  of  the
          quantizer.

     -q stepsize
          This is the size of the quantization interval (Delta).

     -n num
          This is the number of inputs to  be  generate  for  the
          simulation.   It is difficult to get a reasonably accu-
          rate estimate with num less than 10,000.

     -d distribution
          This is a number specifying the input probability  dis-
          tribution A value of 0 corresponds to Uniform distribu-
          tion.  A value of 1 corresponds to  Gaussian  distribu-
          tion.   A value of 2 corresponds to Laplacian distribu-
          tion.  A value of 3 corresponds to Gamma  distribution.
          This last option should be used with care, as the func-
          tion generating the Gamma distribution is not  entirely
          reliable.

     -e   If this option is specified the program calculates  the
          output entropy of the quantizer.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
