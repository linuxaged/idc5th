NAME
     misnuq - explores effect of mismatch on nonuniform Lloyd-Max
     quantizers.

SYNOPSIS
     misnuq qfile [ -n num ][ -d distribution ][ -b min_std ][ -m
          max_std ][ -s std_step ][ -e ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to explore the effect  of  mismatch
     between  the  assumptions  about the quantizer input used to
     design a Lloyd-Max quantizer, and the actual  input  statis-
     tics.   This  program  can  be used to explore both mismatch
     between the assumed and  actual  distribution  and  mismatch
     between  the  actual  and  assumed variances.  The quantizer
     parameters are obtained from the file qfile, while the  dis-
     tribution  of  the  input is specified by the user. The file
     qfile contains the number of  levels,  boundary  and  recon-
     struction  values  for  the nonuniform quantizer.  The first
     number is the number of reconstruction levels in  the  quan-
     tizer,  numlev.   The  next (numlev-1) numbers are the inner
     boundary values  (note  that  there  are  numlev+1  boundary
     values.  The extreme values are assumed to be plus and minus
     infinity.  The next numlev  values  are  the  reconstruction
     values.  Some quan_files should be available at the location
     you found this program.  The name of the files  are  of  the
     form  xxnn.dat,  xx is ga for Gaussian, la for Laplacian and
     gm for Gamma.  nn denotes the number of levels.


     The program simulates a range of input variances,  specified
     by the user.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     rangen

     nuquan_enc

     nuquan_dec

     ent

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -n num
          This is the number of inputs to  be  generate  for  the
          simulation.   It is difficult to get a reasonably accu-
          rate estimate with num less than 10,000.

     -d distribution
          This is a number specifying the input probability  dis-
          tribution A value of 0 corresponds to Uniform distribu-
          tion.  A value of 1 corresponds to  Gaussian  distribu-
          tion.   A value of 2 corresponds to Laplacian distribu-
          tion.  A value of 3 corresponds to Gamma  distribution.
          This last option should be used with care, as the func-
          tion generating the Gamma distribution is not  entirely
          reliable.

     -b min_std
          This is the smallest value of  the  range  of  standard
          deviations to be generated

     -m max_std
          This is the largest value  of  the  range  of  standard
          deviations to be generated

     -s std_step
          The standard deviations to be generated are incremented
          in steps of std_step.

     -e   If this option is specified the program calculates  the
          output entropy of the quantizer.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
