NAME
     progt_enc - program to experiment with different  approxima-
     tions to use for progressive image transmission.

SYNOPSIS
     progt_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile ][  -x  row_size  ][  -y
          col_size ][ -m mode ][ -b blocksize ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program  can  be  used  to  experiment  with  different
     approximations  to use for progressive transmission applica-
     tion.  Currently there are two modes available.  In  mode  1
     each  block  of  pixels  is approximated by the value of the
     pixel in the top left corner of the block.  In mode  2  each
     block  of pixels is approximated by the average value of the
     pixels in the block.  Further modes can easily be added.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readimage

     image_size

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The name of the file containing the input  image.   The
          image is assumed to be stored using 8 bits/pixel in raw
          format.

     -o outfile
          This will contain the approximation to the input image.
          If  this  option  is  not  used  the program writes the
          approximation to standard out.  This is useful  if  the
          output  of  the  program  is  to be piped directly to a
          variable length coder.

     -m mode
          There are currently two modes as described above.

     -x row_size
          This is the number of pixels in each row of the image.

     -y col_size
          This is the number of rows of pixels.


     -h   This option will provide the usage.
