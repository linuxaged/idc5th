NAME
     distau - computes various performance measures between  ori-
     ginal and reconstructed speech and audio files.

SYNOPSIS
     distau file1 file2 [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program computes the mean squared error, mean  absolute
     error,  and signal to noise ratio (in dB), between file1 and
     file2.  It assumes file1 to be the original speech/audio and
     file2  to be the reconstructed speech/audio. The samples are
     assumed to be 16 bit uniformly quantized stored in raw  for-
     mat.

     If A[i] is the i'th sample value of  the  original  (file1),
     R[i]   is   the  i'th  sample  value  of  the  reconstructed
     speech/audio, and < > denotes average value, then  the  per-
     formance  measures  computed  by this program are defined as
     follows.

     mean squared error = <(A[i] - R[i])^2>.

     mean absolute error = <|A[i] - R[i]|>.

     signal to noise ratio = <A[i]^2> / <(I[i,j] - R[i])^2>.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     readau

     get_file_size

     and the header file idc.h
