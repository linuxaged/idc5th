NAME
     trainvq - trains a vector quantizer codebook.

SYNOPSIS
     trainvq ts_file [ -c codefile ][ -d dimension ][ -b  cb_size
          ][ -t ts_size ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to train a vector  quantizer  using
     the  LBG  algorithm.  The purpose of this program is more to
     allow the user to explore the process, for specific applica-
     tions  the program would have to be modified.  There is also
     a program available for training a vector quantizer specifi-
     cally for image compression - trvqsp_img.  This program uses
     either a user specified initial codebook or selects the ini-
     tial  codebook  from the training set.  A more sophisticated
     approach is used by the program  trvqsplit  which  uses  the
     splitting approach specified by Linde, Buzo, and Gray.   The
     program does not attempt to resolve the empty cell problem.

     The ts_file contains the training set.   The  program  needs
     the following subroutines:

     vqencode

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -c codefile
          This is the file containing the initial  codebook.   If
          no  file  name  for  the  initial codebook is provided,
          then when the codebook size  is  available,  that  many
          vectors  from  the training set are used as the initial
          codebook.

     -d dimension
          This is the dimension of the vectors.

     -b cb_size
          This is the size of the codebook.

     -t ts_size
          This is the size of the training set.  This  should  be
          considerably larger than the codebook size.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
