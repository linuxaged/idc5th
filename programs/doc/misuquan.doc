     ers.

DESCRIPTION
     This program can be used to explore the effect  of  mismatch
     between  the  assumptions  about the quantizer input used to
     design a uniform quantizer, and the actual input statistics.
     This  program  can  be used to explore both mismatch between
     the assumed and actual distribution and mismatch between the
     actual  and  assumed  variances.   The  quantizer  and input
     parameters are specified by the user.


     The program simulates a range of input variances,  specified
     by the user.

     The program needs the following subroutines:

     rangen

     uquan_enc

     uquan_dec

     ent

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -l numlev
          This is the size of the reproduction  alphabet  of  the
          quantizer.

     -q stepsize
          This is the size of the quantization interval (Delta).

     -n num
          This is the number of inputs to  be  generate  for  the
          simulation.   It is difficult to get a reasonably accu-
          rate estimate with num less than 10,000.

     -d distribution
          This is a number specifying the input probability  dis-
          tribution A value of 0 corresponds to Uniform distribu-
          tion.   A  value   of   1   corresponds   to   Gaussian
          distribution.   A  value  of 2 corresponds to Laplacian
          distribution.  A value of 3 corresponds to  Gamma  dis-
          tribution.   This last option should be used with care,
          as the function generating the  Gamma  distribution  is
          not entirely reliable.

     -b min_std
          This is the smallest value of  the  range  of  standard
          deviations to be generated

     -m max_std
          This is the largest value  of  the  range  of  standard
          deviations to be generated

     -s std_step
          The standard deviations to be generated are incremented
          in steps of std_step.

     -e   If this option is specified the program calculates  the
          output entropy of the quantizer.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
