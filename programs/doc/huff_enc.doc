NAME
     huff_enc - encodes a file using huffman encoding

SYNOPSIS
     huff_enc [ -i infile ][ -o outfile  ][  -c  codefile  ][  -s
          storecode ][ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program takes a file and encodes it.   It  will  either
     read  a code to use from a file or it will calculate its own
     code to use.  The code used will either be  written  at  the
     start  of  the  encoded file or it can be written to its own
     file.


     The program needs the following subroutines:

     value

     sort

     huff

     files

     create_code

     create_list

     getcode

     and the header file idc.h


OPTIONS
     -i infile
          The name of the file containing the input. The  program
          will  check  the size of the file before it encodes it.
          If this option is not given  the  program  assumes  the
          input is being piped and will read from stdin.


     -o outfile
          The name of the file the encoded file should be written
          to.  If this option is not given the program will write
          to stdout.

     -c codefile
          The name of the file if you want to use a  stored  code
          instead  of calculating one. The defalt is to calculate
          a code.

     -s storecode
          The name of the file you want the code written to.   If
          no  filename  is  given  the  code will be written as a
          header on the encoded file.

     -h   This option will provide the usage.
